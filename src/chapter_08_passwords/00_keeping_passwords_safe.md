Keeping passwords safe
======================

Passwords are like keys in the physical world. If you lose a password you will not be able to get in, and if others copy or steal it they can use it to enter. A good password should not be easy for others to guess and not easy to crack with computers, while still being easy for you to remember.

Password length and complexity
------------------------------

To protect your passwords from being guessed, length and complexity are the key factors. Passwords like the name of your pet or a birth date are very unsafe; also any word that appears in a dictionary is easily guessed by a computer. You should also never use a password containing only numbers. You should use a password containing a combination of lower case letters, capitals, numbers and special characters.

For use with important stuff e.g. the pass phrase which protects your PGP/GPG or TrueCrypt encrypted data, or the password for your main email account or an important Twitter account, use at least 20 characters or more, the longer the better.

Minimizing damage
-----------------

It is important to minimize the damage if one of your passwords is ever compromised. Use different passwords for different websites or accounts, that way if one is compromised, the others are not. Change your passwords from time to time, especially for accounts you consider to be sensitive. By doing this you can block access to an attacker who may have learned your old password.

Physical protection
-------------------

When using a public computer such as at a library, an internet cafe, or any computer you do not own, there are several dangers. Using "over the shoulder" surveillance, someone, possibly with a camera, can watch your actions and may see the account you log in to and the password you type. A less obvious threat is software programs or hardware devices called "keystroke loggers" that record what you type. They can be hidden inside a computer or a keyboard and are not easily spotted. Do not use public computers to log in to your private accounts, such as email. If you do, change your passwords as soon as you get back to a computer you own and trust.

Easy to remember and secure passwords
-------------------------------------

One way to create strong and easy to remember passwords is to use sentences.

A few examples:

 * `IloveDouglasAdamsbecausehe'sreallyawesome.`
 * `Peoplelovemachinesin2029A.D.`
 * `BarneyfromHowIMetYourMotherisAWESOME!`

Sentences are easy to remember, even if they are 50 characters long and contain uppercase characters, lowercase characters, symbols and numbers.

Using an application to keep your passwords
-------------------------------------------

Even easy-to-remember passwords might be difficult to manage. One solution is to use a dedicated application to manage most of your passwords. The application we will discuss is *Keepass* which is a free and open password manager that is considered to be secure (given that you chose a sane and secure "master password" for the keepass application).

For website passwords a more convenient solution that is probably safe enough for most of your passwords is to use the built-in password manager of the Firefox browser. Be sure to set a master password as is explained in the chapter on safe browsing, otherwise this is very insecure! Other browsers might also come with built-in password managers, but remember that if you don't have to unlock them with a master password they are mostly unsafe and easily retrievable by attackers having access to your computer.

Protect your Website Passwords
------------------------------

Browsers offer to save the login information and passwords for websites you use. If you choose to save the passwords, you should make sure that the passwords are stored in a safe way. See the chapter about Keeping your internet passwords safe in Firefox.

Caveats
-------

 * If an application on your computer, like a chat or mail program, stores the password it uses, and you are not asked for it after reopening the program, it often means that it can be easily retrieved from your computer by someone having access (physical or otherwise) to it.
 * If your login information is sent over an insecure connection or channel, it might fall into the wrong hands. (see the chapters on secure browsing for more information)
 * Over the shoulder surveillance or key logging might compromise your passwords.
