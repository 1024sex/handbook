Accessing Firefox on Ubuntu
===========================

Firefox is already installed on Ubuntu as part of the normal installation. If you want to install a different (most commonly newer) version of Firefox on your Ubuntu system (or other GNU/Linux systems) that is also possible and is explained below.

Accessing it is easy. Click on the Unity side bar where you see the Firefox icon:

Firefox starts and a welcome window opens:

If you want to upgrade the version of Firefox included with Ubuntu to the latest version,  such as a beta version or a new stable version, replacing your existing version, a detailed guide is available on the Ubuntu wiki at [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion)
