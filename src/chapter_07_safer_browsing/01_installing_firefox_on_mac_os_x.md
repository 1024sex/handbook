 3. Click and hold the **Firefox** icon, then drag it on top of the **Applications** icon. When it is on top of the Applications icon, release the mouse button. This starts copying the program files to the Applications directory on your computer.

 4. When the installation step is finished, close the two small Firefox windows.
 5. Eject the Firefox disk image. If this does not work by normal means, select the disk image icon and then, in the Finder menu, select `File > Eject Firefox`.
 6. Now, open the **Applications** directory and drag the **Firefox** icon to the dock:

If you have permission problems when trying to copy Firefox from the disk image to your Applications folder, first try deleting your old Firefox copy, then proceeding.

If you're installing a beta and that you want to keep your former Firefox copy, first rename your old Firefox copy to something like "Firefox old" and then copy the beta to your Applications folder.
